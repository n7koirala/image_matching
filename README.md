# HyDia: FHE-based Facial Matching with Hybrid Approximations and Diagonalization

### PETS 2025 Artifact – README

This repository contains the full artifact (code + environment) for our PETS 2025 paper titled "HyDia: FHE-based Facial Matching with Hybrid Approximations and Diagonalization".  
Follow these steps below to  (1) build the Docker image, (2) run the five face‑matching approaches, (3) capture their latency/parameter output and (4) generate the figures present in the manuscript.

---

## 1 · Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/n7koirala/image_matching.git
cd image_matching
```

## 2 · Build the Docker image

If Docker is not installed, please refer to [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker for Ubuntu 22.04. Then, proceed with building the docker file:

```
docker build --tag popets2025-hydia .
```

- Installs all system prerequisites on top of Ubuntu 22.04
(build‑essential, cmake, libomp, etc.).

- Fetches and compiles OpenFHE v1.2.3.

- Fetches and installs all the dependendies for generating the figures.

- Compiles the project into ```/opt/image_matching/build```.


## 3 · Run the test & capture output

First create a directory where you want to store the generated figures from the manuscript. 

```
mkdir -p ~/artifacts_output
```

Run the command below to execute all five approaches described in the paper and store the result (latency statistics for the **Membership** and **Index** scenarios, FHE parameters used, and basic correctness checks etc.) under ```output.log```. It then generates all the figures present in manuscript under ```~/artifact_output``` .

```
docker run --rm -v ~/artifact_output:/tmp popets2025-hydia | tee output.log
```


## 4 · Using a larger database (optional)

```run_artifact.sh``` inside the container will use a pre-generated small encrypted database of 2<sup>10</sup> facial‐feature vectors. Optionally, the database size can be easily changed to a higher number (up to 2<sup>20</sup>) after that specific amount of vectors are generated using the ```generate_data.sh``` script located under ```/tool```. For instance to generate 2<sup>15</sup>, run ```generate_data.sh "2_15.dat" $((2**15))```.
Then, edit ```run_artifact.sh``` to update your changes.




## Usage

### Generating Experimental Datasets

To generate an experimental dataset, run the following script from the `build` folder:
```bash
../tools/generate_data.sh [FILENAME] [SIZE]
```

Note that the dataset will be automatically placed in the `test` folder. For example, to generate a dataset with 1024 database vectors located at `/test/2_10.dat`, try:
```bash
../tools/generate_data.sh "2_10.dat" $((2**10))
```


### Latency Experiments

To run the latency experiments upon the image matching application, navigate to the `build` folder and use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./ImageMatching ../test/[FILENAME] [APPROACH]
```

The `[FILENAME]` parameter must correspond to an existing file generated by the above scripts.

The `[APPROACH]` parameter determines which algorithm is used to perform the encrypted facial matching upon the provided dataset. The possibilities for this parameter are given below:

| Parameter | Experimental Approach                     |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1         | Literature Baseline Approach              |
| 2         | GROTE Approach (Baseline + Group Testing) |
| 3         | Blind-Match Approach                      |
| 4         | HERS Approach                             |
| 5         | HyDia Approach (Ours)                     |

For instance, try:
```bash
./ImageMatching ../test/2_10.dat 1
```

This will execute the main application, showcasing both image matching algorithms, more specifically their encryption, matching, and decryption steps.

### Accuracy Experiments

To run the accuracy experiments upon the image matching application, navigate to the `build` folder and use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./ImageMatchingAccuracy [SUBJECT_INDEX] [APPROACH]
```

The `[SUBJECT_INDEX]` parameter determines which facial template vector is used as the query vector. The query dataset includes 50 randomly sampled facial template vectors which can be used, therefore this parameter must be an integer in the range 0-49.

The `[APPROACH]` parameter determines which algorithm is used to perform the encrypted facial matching upon the provided dataset. The possibilities for this parameter are given below:

| Parameter | Experimental Approach                     |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1         | Literature Baseline Approach              |
| 2         | GROTE Approach (Baseline + Group Testing) |
| 3         | Blind-Match Approach                      |
| 4         | HERS Approach                             |
| 5         | HyDia Approach (Ours)                     |

For instance, try:
```bash
./ImageMatchingAccuracy 0 5
```

This experiment performs the designated approach upon the FRGC 2.0 dataset, reporting the number of true/false positives and negatives produced by the approach. The experiment also reports the number of true/false positives and negatives produced by the facial feature extractor without any encryption, for purposes of comparison.

## Configuration

### Parameters

The application can be configured using various parameters defined in the source code. Key parameters include:

- **Similarity Match Threshold**: Set the cosine similarity value above which vectors are considered to be matching.
- **Comparison Depth**: Set the multiplicative depth to be used by the comparison-approximating function.
- **Alpha-Norm Depth**: Set the multiplicative depth to be used by the alpha-norm maximum approximation in the group-testing approach.
- **CPU Cores**: Set the maximum number of CPU cores to be allotted to the enroller, receiver, and sender in multi-threaded operations.
- **Security Level**: Configure the security level of the CKKS scheme.
- **Scaling Mod Size**: Configure the size for the scaling modulus of the CKKS scheme.

### Example Configuration

```cpp
// include/config.h
const double MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.85;
const size_t COMP_DEPTH = 10;
const size_t ALPHA_DEPTH = 2;
const size_t MAX_NUM_CORES = 32;
```

```cpp
// src/main.cpp
CCParams<CryptoContextCKKSRNS> parameters;
parameters.SetSecurityLevel(HEStd_128_classic);
parameters.SetScalingModSize(45);
parameters.SetScalingTechnique(FIXEDMANUAL);
```
