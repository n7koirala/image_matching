# Image Matching README

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Image Matching** project! This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of two image matching algorithms. The **Membership Scenario** determines whether a query image possesses any matches among a database of images. The **Index Scenario** determines which specific database images, if any, match with a query image.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a robust framework for the comparison and matching of facial representation vectors using advanced cryptographic techniques, specifically homomorphic encryption.

For theoretical details of this implementation, refer to this document: [Image Matching Documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/read/cbqxkzbbxjvd#ea7444).

## Features

- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Leverages the OpenFHE library to perform secure computations on encrypted data.
- **Biometric Standards**: Complies with standards set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
- **Parallel Processing**: Supports parallel processing to enhance performance.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a modern C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later.
- **CMake**: Build system generator (version 3.10 or later).
- **OpenFHE Library**: For homomorphic encryption operations.
- **Standard Libraries**: Standard libraries for image processing and mathematical computations.

## Installation

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/n7koirala/image_matching.git
    cd image_matching
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed:
    - OpenFHE
    - CMake
    - Standard C++ libraries

3. **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

## Usage

To run the image matching application, navigate to the `build` folder and use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./image_matching ../test/[image_file.dat]
```

<!For instance, try:
```bash
./image_matching ../test/2^10.dat
```>


This will execute the main application, showcasing both image matching algorithms, more specifically their encryption, matching, and decryption steps.


## Configuration

### Parameters

The application can be configured using various parameters defined in the source code. Key parameters include:

- **Similarity Match Threshold**: Set the cosine similarity value above which vectors are considered to be matching.
- **Sign Depth**: Set the maximum multiplicative depth of the sign-approximating polynomial.
- **Multiplicative Depth**: Set the depth of multiplicative operations.
- **Scaling Mod Size**: Configure the size for scaling modulus.
- **Batch Size**: Determine the batch size for encoding parameters.

### Example Configuration

```cpp
// include/config.h
const double MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.85;
const int SIGN_DEPTH = 13;
```

```cpp
// src/main.cpp
uint32_t multDepth = SIGN_DEPTH + 1;
CCParams<CryptoContextCKKSRNS> parameters;
parameters.SetSecurityLevel(HEStd_128_classic);
parameters.SetMultiplicativeDepth(multDepth);
parameters.SetScalingModSize(45);
```
