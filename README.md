# Image Matching README

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Image Matching** project! This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of two image matching algorithms. The **Membership Scenario** determines whether a query image possesses any matches among a database of images. The **Index Scenario** determines which specific database images, if any, match with a query image.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a robust framework for the comparison and matching of facial representation vectors using advanced cryptographic techniques, specifically homomorphic encryption.

<!For theoretical details of this implementation, refer to this document: [Image Matching Documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/read/cbqxkzbbxjvd#ea7444).>

## Features

- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Leverages the OpenFHE library to perform secure computations on encrypted data.
- **Biometric Standards**: Complies with standards set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
- **Parallel Processing**: Supports parallel processing to enhance performance.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a modern C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later.
- **CMake**: Build system generator (version 3.10 or later).
- **OpenFHE Library**: For homomorphic encryption operations.
- **Standard Libraries**: Standard libraries for image processing and mathematical computations.

## Installation

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed:
    - OpenFHE
    - CMake
    - Standard C++ libraries

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/n7koirala/image_matching.git
    cd image_matching
    ```

3. **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

3. **Set up Experiment Tracking**:
    ```bash
    mkdir output
    ../tools/setup_experiment.sh
    ```

## Usage

### Generating Experimental Datasets

To generate an experimental dataset, run the following script from the `build` folder:

```bash
../tools/generate_data.sh [FILENAME] [SIZE]
```

Note that the dataset will be automatically placed in the `test` folder. For example, to generate a dataset with 1024 database vectors located at `/test/2^10.dat`, try:
```bash
../tools/generate_data.sh "2^10.dat" $((2**10))
```

### Running Experiments

To run the image matching application from the `build` folder, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./ImageMatching ../test/[FILENAME] [APPROACH]
```

The `[FILENAME]` parameter must correspond to an existing file generated by the 

The `[APPROACH]` parameter determines which algorithm is used to perform the encrypted facial matching upon the provided dataset. The possibilities for this parameter are given below:

| Parameter | Experimental Approach            |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| 1         | Novel Stacked Linear Transform   |
| 2         | Literature Baseline              |
| 3         | GROTE (Baseline + Group Testing) |
| 4         | Blind-Match                      |
| 5         | Novel Diagonal Linear Transform  |

For instance, try:
```bash
./image_matching ../test/2^10.dat 1
```


This will execute the main application, showcasing both image matching algorithms, more specifically their encryption, matching, and decryption steps.


## Configuration

### Parameters

The application can be configured using various parameters defined in the source code. Key parameters include:

- **Similarity Match Threshold**: Set the cosine similarity value above which vectors are considered to be matching.
- **Comparison Depth**: Set the multiplicative depth to be used by the comparison-approximating function.
- **Alpha-Norm Depth**: Set the multiplicative depth to be used by the alpha-norm maximum approximation in the group-testing approach.
- **CPU Cores**: Set the maximum number of CPU cores to be allotted to the enroller, receiver, and sender in multi-threaded operations.
- **Security Level**: Configure the security level of the CKKS scheme.
- **Scaling Mod Size**: Configure the size for the scaling modulus of the CKKS scheme.

### Example Configuration

```cpp
// include/config.h
const double MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.85;
const size_t COMP_DEPTH = 10;
const size_t ALPHA_DEPTH = 2;
const size_t MAX_NUM_CORES = 32;
```

```cpp
// src/main.cpp
CCParams<CryptoContextCKKSRNS> parameters;
parameters.SetSecurityLevel(HEStd_128_classic);
parameters.SetScalingModSize(45);
parameters.SetScalingTechnique(FIXEDMANUAL);
```
